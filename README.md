# DeathMatch

A gamemode I made in a week to showcase my knowledge in the Bukkit API. Still very prototypical in nature.

Best played with old combat mechanics. Gamemode mechanics are inspired by an old server I played on back in 2013 (craftingfaction.com).

Special thanks to: Shankse (geopai), Jakob, Jonathan, IgnisWright, LangScott, and Anton for helping bug test.
